\Chapter{Detector Research and Development}
\label{Ch4}

The research and development (R\& D) of PROSPECT detector began in 2014.
Multiple prototypes were assembled to in the R\& D phase to develop and demonstrate a variety of detector design.
In this phase, many candidate materials were tested. 
The time line of the PROSPECT R\& D is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Prototypes}
